# Novum Infusion Pump - Verification & Validation

Overview  

• This document describes the Verification & Validation (V&V) framework for Novum Infusion Pumps integrated with DeviceBridge v4.3.8.  
• It covers both device configuration (USB-based setup) and system-level integration (MQTT over VerneMQ), ensuring reliable communication and compliance with medical device quality standards.

Objectives  

•	Reliability & Safety: Ensure accurate and secure ingestion of infusion events.  
•	Performance & Scalability: Meet latency and throughput targets under peak clinical loads.  
•	Fault Tolerance: Validate system resilience against network, broker, and pump-level failures.  
•	Compliance: Align with FDA 21 CFR 820.30, IEC 62304, ISO 14971, IEC 60601, IEC 62366.  
•	Clinical Utility: Validate workflows for infusion setup, alarms, and nurse acknowledgement.  
________________________________________
Verification

•	MQTT Communication: TLS, QoS 1/2 delivery, ACL validation, negative tests for expired/invalid certs and broker restarts.  
•	Functional Testing: Ingestion of infusion events, duplicate handling, retry/backoff, dead-letter queue routing.  
•	Database Integrity: Schema validation, referential integrity, rollback verification.  
•	Non-Functional:  
o	Latency ≤ 2s (P95).  
o	Sustained load and burst testing.  
o	Soak testing (72h).  
o	Resilience against broker restart, network loss, Wi-Fi reconnect.  
________________________________________
Validation 

•	Clinical Workflow Testing: infusion start/stop, pause/resume, dose change, alarm propagation and acknowledgement.  
•	Usability (IEC 62366): nurse workflows, human factors, mitigation of use errors.  
•	UAT Sign-Off: execution of validation protocols, evidence logs, SME approvals.

Deliverables

•	IQ Protocol & Report (pump config, network setup, logs).  
•	OQ Protocol & Report (functional, interface, non-functional tests).  
•	PQ Protocol & Report (clinical workflows, alarms, usability).  
•	Requirements & Risk Traceability Matrix.  
•	Cybersecurity Assessment & Vulnerability Triage.  
•	Final V&V Summary & Release Recommendation.  
________________________________________
Toolchain

•	Pump-side: USB config files, checksum tools, on-device logs.  
•	System-side: VerneMQ admin tools, kubectl for DeviceBridge, Doppelio simulator, Grafana/Prometheus, Splunk/Loki, JAMA for traceability.
